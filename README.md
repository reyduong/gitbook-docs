# Welcome to Column Load Takedown Application !

The **Column Load Takedown Application (CLTA)** is designed to streamlines early structural analysis by providing engineers with preliminary load take-down assessments from raw Revit models. Ideal for scenarios lacking a full analytical model, it offers a tentative solution to accelerate the evaluation process.
